# 定义新的函数
## 1.3.1environments
What if a formal parameter has the same name as a built-in function? Can two functions share names without confusion? To resolve such questions, we must describe environments in more detail.
如果一个形式参数和一个内置函数具有相同的名字呢？两个函数可以不混淆地共享名字吗？为了解决这些问题，我们必须更详细地描述环境。

An environment in which an expression is evaluated consists of a sequence of frames, depicted as boxes. Each frame contains bindings, which associate a name with its corresponding value. There is a single global frame that contains name bindings for all built-in functions (only abs and max are shown). We indicate the global frame with a globe symbol.
评估表达式的环境由一系列栈帧组成，如方框所示。每个栈帧都包含绑定，这些绑定将一个名称与其相应的值相关联。有一个全局栈帧，其中包含所有内置函数的名称绑定（仅显示abs和max）。我们用全局符号表示全局栈帧。

Assignment and import statements add entries to the first frame of the current environment. So far, our environment consists only of the global frame.
赋值和导入语句将添加条目到当前环境的第一帧，到目前为止，我们的环境只包含全局栈帧。
``` python
from math import pi
tau = 2 * pi
```

A def statement also binds a name to the function created by the definition. The resulting environment after defining square appears below:
def语句将一个名称绑定到自定义创建的函数。

These environment diagrams show the bindings of the current environment, along with the values (which are not part of any frame) to which names are bound. Notice that the name of a function is repeated, once in the frame, and once as part of the function itself. This repetition is intentional: many different names may refer to the same function, but that function itself has only one intrinsic name. However, looking up the value for a name in an environment only inspects name bindings. The intrinsic name of a function does not play a role in looking up names. In the example we saw earlier,
这些环境图显示当前环境的绑定，以及绑定名称的值（不是任何栈帧的一部分）。**注意一个函数的名字是重复的，一个在栈帧中，一个是函数本身的一部分。**
这种重复是有意的：**很多不同的名字可能指向相同的函数，但是函数本身只有一个固有的名字。**
但是，在环境中查找名称的值只会检查名称绑定。函数的内在名称在查找名称中不起作用。

``` python
f = max
f
<built-in function max>
```

The name max is the intrinsic name of the function, and that's what you see printed as the value for f. In addition, both the names max and f are bound to that same function in the global environment.

As we proceed to introduce additional features of Python, we will have to extend these diagrams. Every time we do, we will list the new features that our diagrams can express.

max名字是函数的固有名字，这就是您所看到的打印值f。另外，**在全局环境中，这两个函数名字max和f绑定的函数是一样的。**

随着我们继续介绍Python的其他功能，我们将不得不扩展这些图表。每当我们做，我们将列出我们的图表可以表达的新功能。
